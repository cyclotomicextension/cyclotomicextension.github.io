<p>Hello, my name is Additi Pandey and I love learning languages and teaching stuff on Mathematics and Cognition- it allows me guage my understanding as well as share my passion with people. My interests are in Cognitive Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Functional Programming, Number Theory and Etymology. My MSc thesis was titled "Reciprocity Laws" that dealt with the quadratic and the cubic reciprocity laws, and primes of the form x<sup>2</sup> + ny<sup>2</sup>.<p>

<p>I am pursuing my master's in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London and I did my bachelor's in Mathematics from Jesus and Mary College, University of Delhi. I also attended a graduate summer school at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.<p>
  
 <p> I have a strong inclination towards languages and I am fluent in English and Hindi. I am a beginner in French which I learnt at Alliance Franciase de Delhi and I am currently learning Japanese. I have started reading literature on Hindu mythology to become fluent in Sanskrit, which I have learnt in school for three years. I am passionate about photography and art as well.
