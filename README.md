Hello, my name is Additi Pandey and I like exploring things that are "merely real". My interests are in Cognitive Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Number Theory and Etymology.

<p>I did my master's in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London and my bachelor's in Mathematics from Jesus and Mary College, University of Delhi. I also attended a graduate summer school at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.<p>

<p>This webpage contains links to my resume as well as articles exploring my interests offering an original presentation of the same.<p>
