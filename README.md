<p>Hello, my name is Additi Pandey and I love learning languages and teaching stuff on Mathematics and Cognition- it allows me guage my understanding as well as share my passion with people. My interests are in Cognitive Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Functional Programming, Number Theory and Etymology. My MSc thesis titled "Quadratic & Cubic Reciprocity Laws" dealt with the quadratic and the cubic reciprocity laws, and primes of the form x<sup>2</sup> + ny<sup>2</sup>. I focus upon mathematics of AI & ML, especially 
(1) mathematical reasoning to neural networks, 
(2) targeted learning, 
(3) causation, transfer learning and continual learning. <p>

<p>I am pursued my master's in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London and I did my bachelor's in Mathematics from Jesus and Mary College, University of Delhi. I also attended a graduate summer school at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. I have done research in the areas of Epidemic Modelling, Geometry and Group Theory from IIT Kanpur, Delhi University and Harish Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad.<p>
  
 <p>I have a strong inclination towards languages and I am fluent in English and Hindi. I am a beginner in French which I learnt at Alliance Francaise de Delhi. I am trying to revise Sanskrit and Latin. I have learnt the former in school for three years, and have attended several programmes offered by Logophilia Education Pvt. Ltd., which propelled me to learn Latin. I am very interested in learning to write Hiragana. I am also learning Bharatnatyam from Prayag Sangeet Samiti, India. I am passionate about photography and digital art as well. You can visit my instagram handles if you wish to have a look into my gallery.

In addition to all this, I really enjoy archery, which I pursued for a week at Imperial, and I am currently looking forward to join one of its clubs in India. <p>

<p>This webpage contains my resume, link to my blog and projects which I worked upon to explore my interests in the aforementioned fields.
