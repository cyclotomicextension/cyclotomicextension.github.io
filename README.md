<p>My name is Additi Pandey. I am a graduate student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. My interests are in differential equations, number theory and formalising mathematics (checkout my repositories Formalising Mathematics Project <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-1">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-2">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-3">3</a> as well as <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2022/07/29/teaching-formalisation-to-mathematics-undergraduates/">this</a>), and I am currently trying to learn probability theory. I work vaguely at the intersection of Differential Equations and Scientific Machine Learning. My Master's thesis, entitled "Quadratic & Cubic Reciprocity Laws," delved into the intricacies of the quadratic and cubic reciprocity laws, as well as primes of the form x<sup>2</sup> + ny<sup>2</sup>.<p>

<p>I hold a Master of Science degree in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Jesus and Mary College, University of Delhi. In addition, I attended a graduate summer school in 2021 at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and a summer school on AI and computer vision in 2023 at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. My research experience encompasses work in the areas of algebraic number theory, epidemic modeling, geometry, and group theory, which I have conducted at institutions such as Imperial College London, IIT Kanpur, Delhi University, and the Harish Chandra Research Institute in Allahabad.<p>
