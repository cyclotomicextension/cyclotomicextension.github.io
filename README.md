<p>My name is Additi Pandey. My interests are in number theory, probability theory and formalising mathematics (checkout my repositories Formalising Mathematics Project <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-1">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-2">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-3">3</a> as well as <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2022/07/29/teaching-formalisation-to-mathematics-undergraduates/">this</a>), and etymology. My Master's thesis, entitled "Quadratic & Cubic Reciprocity Laws," delved into the intricacies of the quadratic and cubic reciprocity laws, as well as primes of the form x<sup>2</sup> + ny<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, I am particularly interested in probabilistic number theory  and random matrix theory.<p>

<p>I hold a Master of Science degree in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Jesus and Mary College, University of Delhi. In addition, I was enrolled in a graduate summer school in the summer of 2021 at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. My research experience encompasses work in the areas of epidemic modeling, geometry, and group theory, which I have conducted at institutions such as IIT Kanpur, Delhi University, and the Harish Chandra Research Institute in Allahabad.<p>
