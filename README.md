<p>Hello, my name is Additi Pandey and I love learning languages and teaching stuff on Mathematics and Cognition- it allows me guage my understanding as well as share my passion with people. My interests are in Cognitive Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Functional Programming, Number Theory and Etymology. My MSc thesis was titled "Reciprocity Laws" that dealt with the quadratic and the cubic reciprocity laws, and primes of the form x<sup>2</sup> + ny<sup>2</sup>.<p>

<p>I am pursuing my master's in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London and I did my bachelor's in Mathematics from Jesus and Mary College, University of Delhi. I also attended a graduate summer school at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.<p>
  
 <p> I have a strong inclination towards languages and I am fluent in English and Hindi. I am a beginner in French which I learnt at Alliance Francaise de Delhi and I am currently learning Japanese and trying to become fluent in Sanskrit, which I have learnt in school for three years. I am passionate about photography and art as well. You can visit my instagram handles if you wish to have a look into my gallery. Visit my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cyclotomic_extension/">photography gram</a> and my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/addigitagram/">digital art gram!</a><p>

<p>This webpage contains my resume, link to my blog and projects which I worked upon to explore my interests in the aforementioned fields. If you are interested in these topics as well, <a href="https://cyclotomicextension.blogspot.com/">visit my blog!</a> I, sometimes, share my academic experiences and things that I wish I knew when I was applying for internships.
