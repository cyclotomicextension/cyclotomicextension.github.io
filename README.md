<p>My name is Additi Pandey. I am a PhD candidate in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. My current interests are in numerical analysis, operator learning, PIML, and turbulence. I have previously worked in number theory and formalising mathematics (checkout my repositories Formalising Mathematics Project <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-1">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-2">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/Formalising-Mathematics-Project-3">3</a> as well as <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2022/07/29/teaching-formalisation-to-mathematics-undergraduates/">this</a>). My Master's thesis, entitled <a href="https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/MSc-Thesis-Algebraic-Number-Theory-.git">"Quadratic & Cubic Reciprocity Laws"</a> delved into the intricacies of the quadratic and cubic reciprocity laws, as well as primes of the form x<sup>2</sup> + ny<sup>2</sup>.<p>

<p>I hold a ScM in Applied Mathematics from Brown University, an MSc in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Jesus and Mary College, University of Delhi. Additionally, I attended a graduate summer school at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 2021 and a summer school on AI and computer vision at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, in 2023. My research experience encompasses work in the areas of algebraic number theory, epidemic modeling, geometry, and group theory, which I have conducted at institutions such as Imperial College London, IIT Kanpur, Delhi University, and the Harish Chandra Research Institute in Allahabad.<p>

<p>This website features my resume (perhaps, an outdated one), links to my blog, and a selection of projects that I have undertaken to explore my diverse interests. If you share any of these interests, I invite you to visit my blog, where I occasionally offer reflections and insights on my academic experiences, as well as provide guidance on the internship application process. These can be accessed <a href="http://cyclot0micextension.wordpress.com/">here!</a>.

  <h2>Mentorship</h2>
  <p>
    Outside my own research, I like to mentor students, especially those interested in numerical analysis, operator learning, and physics-informed neural networks.
